#### The library is designed to provide a uniform interface for three distributed KV storages: etcd, ZooKeeper and Consul.

The services have similar but different data models, so we outlined the common features. 

In our implementation, keys form a ZK-like hierarchy. Each key has a version that is uint64 number greater than 0. Newly created keys have version 1. Current version is returned with other data by the most of operations. All the operations supported are listed below. 

Our library has only an asynchronous interface, but if you want a synchronous one, just call `get()` on the returned futures.

### Transactions
Transactions consist of 4 operations: create, set, erase, check. Their descriptions can be found below. At the moment set has different behavior in comparison to ordinary set: when used in transaction, set does not create key if it does not exist. Besides using any of the operations you cannot assign watch. Transaction body is separated into two blocks: firstly you should write all required checks and then the sequence of other operations <i>(see an example below)</i>. As a result you get a list of new versions for all the keys involved in set operations.

## Supported platforms

The library is currently tested on

- Ubuntu 18.04

  Full support.

- MacOS

  Full support.

- Windows 10

  Only Consul is supported.

## Dependencies

  - C++ compiler

    Currently tested compilers are

    - VS 2019
    - g++ 7.4.0
    - clang

    VS 2017 is known to fail.

  - [CMake](https://cmake.org)

    We suggest using cmake bundled with vcpkg.

  - [vcpkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg)

## Developer workflow

- Copy all ports from `liboffkv/vcpkg/ports/` to `[vcpkg root]/ports` or create corresponding symbolic links.

  Note that the original vcpkg curl port is broken. Use fixed version from this repo.

- Install dependencies

  ```sh
  # from vcpkg root
  vcpkg install ppconsul etcdcpp zkpp
  ```

  Installing all three packages is not required. See control flags at the next step.

- Build tests

    ```sh
    # from liboffkv directory
    mkdir cmake-build-debug && cd $_
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
          -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<replace with path to vcpkg.cmake>" \
          -DBUILD_TESTS=ON ..
    cmake --build .
    ```

    You can control the set of supported services with the following flags

    - `-DBUILD_ZK=[ON|OFF]`
    - `-DBUILD_ETCD=[ON|OFF]`
    - `-DBUILD_CONSUL=[ON|OFF]`

    Sometimes you may also need to specify `VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET`.

- Run tests

  ```sh
  # from liboffkv/cmake-build-debug directory
  make test
  ```

## Usage
```cpp
    #include "client.hpp"
    #include "error.hpp"
    #include "result.hpp"
    
    
    int main() {
        // specify protocol (zk | consul | etcd) and address to connect to the service
        // you can also specify a prefix all the keys will start with
        auto client = connect("consul://127.0.0.1:8500", "/prefix");
        
        // each method returns a future with
        std::future<CreateResult> result = client->create("/key", "value");
        
        // sometimes it is returned with an exception (for more details see "src/client_interface.hpp"
        try {
            std::cout << "Key \"/prefix/key\" created successfully! "
                      << "Its initial version is " << result.get().version << std::endl;
        } catch (EntryExists&) {
            std::cout << "Error: key \"/prefix/key\" already exists!" << std::endl;
        }
        
        
        // commit example (n.b. checks and other ops are separated from each other)
        client->commit(
            {
                {
                    op::Check("/key", 42u),
                    op::Check("/foo"),
                },
                {
                    op::erase("/key"),
                    op::set("/foo", "new_value"),
                }
            }
        ).get();
    }
```
